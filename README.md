# News Reader

## Overview

User are also able to save articles to read again later. (Data is persistant using local storage). Visit the site [here](https://wandrew8.github.io/News-reader/)!

## Tech Used

This application utilizes the News API to fetch data based on news section, daily top headlines, and custom keyword searches. This application was build in an exercise to improve my javascript skills. This application was built completely from scratch with custom styling and design

- JavaScript
- SCSS
- Flexbox and CSS grid
- HTML
- News API

Below are some screen shots of the design and UX:
